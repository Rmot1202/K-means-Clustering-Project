# K-means-Clustering-Project
This project applies K-means clustering to neutron interaction data as part of ongoing research to improve neutron detection systems, including the Next Generation Neutron Detector (NGND). The goal is to uncover patterns in the interaction data without prior labels, helping to inform the design of detector arrays and improve resolution
